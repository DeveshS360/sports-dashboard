Receiving real time data for live match

- To receive a real time data we will be using SSE ( Server Sent Events ) in React
- We'll be opening a connection with backend server with the following url: `${API_BASE_URL}/match-details/${liveMatchId}`
- And after this we'll be receiving data from server continuously without creating manual request ( API polling ) 

Following is the code we'll be writing in App.tsx for creating the connection with the server and receiving real time updates

useEffect(() => {
    
    const eventSource = new EventSource(`${API_BASE_URL}/match-details/${liveMatchId}`);
    
    eventSource.onmessage = (event) => {
      const liveMatchData = JSON.parse(event.data);
      dispatch(setLiveMatchData(liveMatchData))
    };
    
    return () => eventSource.close();
}, []);
